                    <p>I was a club member in a startup aggregator where I started to network with the
                        other people in the club. Thats when I got opportunity to do freelance for a cloth manufacturing
                        company.
                    </p>
                    <p>They managed their inventory using Microsoft Excel, which made their process more time-consuming.
                        They had to switch
                        between so many Excel sheets to get the job done.

                        <span>design interfaces</span> for the
                        web application.
                    </p>

                    <p>I was responsible for designing the interfaces and also put in mind to <span>reduce the
                            time-consuming parts</span> they faced when
                        using Excel sheets.

                    <p>Before starting to design, I took time to understand their supply chain process. I was also able
                        to know
                        how they were using the spreadsheets - from adding enquiries to noting down the status of
                        delivery and payments.
                    </p>

                    <p>I started the sketching the interfaces. After that I asked them to explain what was in the sketch
                        and
                        if they can understand or meeting their expectations. I made some iterations in the sketch.

                    <p>
                        Then, I started designing the screens in Figma.

                        It was the first time doing a freelance project. I also worked under constraints which gave me
                        experience
                        and this would help me in future work. I learnt to work with a client.
