                    <p>
                        During 2nd year of my college, I wanted to build a website. I had some knowledge in frontend
                        development and no idea about the backend. I started looking for a person who can help me
                        in developing backend for the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Luckily, I found a guy who can help me in developing backend for the website and he was from my
                        class.
                        One day, I was discussing with him the problem I had in finding someone to work with me. That's
                        when the
                        question in us raised "Why don't we work on this?".
                        Finally, we teamed up again for building Teamlyst.

                        The discussion showed that we were facing the same issue. I wanted to know if other students
                        face the
                        same problem. This led me to conduct a research. I started conducting quantitative analysis
                        using Google Forms.
                    </p>

                    <p>I almost went to all the dormotories in my hostel to conduct qualitative analysis. I had casual
                        conservation with the
                        students and this helped me to understand their problem.

                    <p>Before starting to design, I took time to understand their supply chain process. I was also able
                        to know
                        how they were using the spreadsheets - from adding enquiries to noting down the status of
                        delivery and payments.

                    <p>I started the sketching the interfaces. After that I asked them to explain what was in the sketch
                        and
                        if they can understand or meeting their expectations. I made some iterations in the sketch.

                        It was the first time doing a freelance project. I also worked under constraints which gave me
                        experience
                        and this would help me in future work. I learnt to work with a client.
